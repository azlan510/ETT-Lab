# Project Overview

Modern server infrastructure commonly uses a combination of virtualization and containerization.
This project focuses on implementing a static website hosting solution using Docker containers deployed inside a virtual machine.

The virtual machine provides operating system level isolation, while Docker ensures lightweight and portable application deployment.

This project is intended for academic learning and practical understanding of VM and Docker-based hosting.
