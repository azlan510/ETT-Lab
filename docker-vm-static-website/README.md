# Static Website Hosting Using Docker on a Virtual Machine

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how a static website can be hosted using Docker containers inside a Linux virtual machine.
The objective is to understand virtualization and containerization concepts used in modern server environments.

The project uses a Type-2 hypervisor to create a virtual machine, inside which Docker will be installed
to deploy a containerized Nginx web server hosting a static website.

## Technologies Used
- Windows (Host OS)
- Type-2 Hypervisor (VirtualBox / VMware)
- Ubuntu Server (Virtual Machine)
- Docker
- Nginx Web Server
- HTML, CSS
- Cloudflare Tunnel
- React (Portfolio Website)
- Node.js


## Project Objectives
- To understand virtual machine setup using a hosted hypervisor
- To deploy Docker inside a virtual machine
- To host a static website using Docker containers
- To study virtualization and container integration
